a bbd theme i use 
there are some known bugs in this, one of which being the typing notifications not rendering correctly on avatar statuses, another is that the member list has to be closed in order to open the emoji picker, an a white box obscures the discord logo occassionally, but youre welcome to tinker with anything you find here, even i though technically didnt make either theme i used in it
